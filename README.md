## My process
I wanted to use React as that is my go to frontend library that I build all my work in. Normally, I default to using Tailwind CSS, and a component UI library such as DaisyUI or MaterialUI. This time I wanted to create it using vanilla CSS.  
I leveraged a reusable card component and did the styling there. 

### Built with

- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
